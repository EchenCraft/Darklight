# Darklight

Alpha 1.6

Changes:
-Ditching BOP for OTG for more diverse worlds, greater control and solution to the Mo Creature issue
-Dropped Astral Sorcery and Ad Inferno, Astral Sorcery still on the table
-Cleaned up unneeded configs

Build Issues:
-Need Ore spawn tweaking in biomes and will be adding back in mob mods one at a time to make the transition easier to config
-Blood Moon spawns causing lag at sun up due to massive amount of burning mobs, need solution without dropping difficulty to much
-"Reurrent Complex" cut off village buildings issue is back. May be an issue with OTG as I didnt see it in the last tests in BOP
-Sapplings make vanilla trees
-Dungeon loot tables vanilla

Confirmed Functions:
-Ores are spawning as they should in a digging test, Need visual confirmation on Draconic ores with World Stripper
-Dungeons Spawning and not causing lag on nightmare
-all loot tables (aside from Dungeons chests) populating properly
-Foliage mods working and populating terrain
-AI is working great and mobs even sometimes break into houses
